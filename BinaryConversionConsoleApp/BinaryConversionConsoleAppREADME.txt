The purpose of this function is to include an optional parameter, and convert a user-entered integer from the decimal number system into the binary number system.
I recognize that some version(s) of this function already exist somewhere in the computer software, but it's to demonstrate an example of an optional parameter.
I recognize that there are probably faster ways to perform this operation, but for relatively small numbers this should be fine.
The function will only work for integers up to Int32 in size.
The first input parameter is the user-entered integer, and the second optional input parameter details the desired number of leading zeros (default is zero).
